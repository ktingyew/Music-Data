# An Analysis of My Music Library
*Last Updated: 08 Jul 2020*

This is just a side project where I do data analysis of my library for fun - some number crunching and a whole lot of visuals. This is still a work in progress, but I think I have exhausted much of the "dimensionality" of my dataset for now. Through this, I have come to recognise certain bias and leanings that I have in my music.

Anyways, for now, this analysis is largely static. In the sense that the analysis this notebook provides is limited towards capturing an instantaneous point in time of my library's contents - i.e. a snapshot. Ideally, this could be expanded to track how my library has evolved as time progressed, but for now I am putting a pin on that. A job for future me.

As an example, here's a couple of graphs that I conjured (they are outdated, but the idea is more or less the same):
